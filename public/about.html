<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m someone who values depth in everything—whether it's in relationships, learning, or experiences.
As an introvert, I take time to open up, but once I do, I form strong and lasting connections. I’ve always 
believed in putting quality over quantity, which is why I’m deeply loyal to the people close to me and care 
a lot about meaningful interactions. Family has always been important to me, and although some relationships 
have shifted over time, I still hold on to the memories and bonds that shaped who I am.
</p>
<p>Academically, I’m driven and dedicated. I’ve achieved a 9.27 GPA in my first semester, which reflects
my consistent effort and resilience—even in moments when I’ve felt overlooked or compared to others. 
I don’t just study to score; I genuinely want to understand what I’m learning. Currently, I’m exploring C++
and thermodynamics, which challenge and excite me in equal measure. I also took a drop year to better prepare
 myself, and while it came with its own emotional weight, it gave me a chance to grow at my own pace.
</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy spending time with people who bring me peace, especially my nani and 
cousins—those rare, comforting moments matter the most. I’m a big fan of the TV show Friends because 
it reminds me of the kind of friendship I value: real, loyal, and a little chaotic. I’m still figuring 
out who I am in a constantly changing world, but I’m learning to be okay with that. Every step, even the
hard ones, is part of becoming the person I want to be.</p>
